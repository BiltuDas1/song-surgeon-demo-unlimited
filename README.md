# Song Surgeon Unlimited Demo (Crack)
Song Surgeon was first released in 2007, and is now a decade old... From its first humble beginnings it has grown to be one of the most popular and valuable tools used by musicians – both students and teacher. At last count Song Surgeon has been sold in more than 120 countries worldwide – and by musicians that play 37 different instruments.

Our newly released Version 5 of Song Surgeon takes the program to a whole new level with the addition of key detection, automatic beat detection, and chord detection. What that means is that when you open a song, Song Surgeon will automatically detect the tempo of a song in BPMs, in will determine the key signature, it will detect the chords – and it will display all of this information on the main user interface so you can see and use it.
